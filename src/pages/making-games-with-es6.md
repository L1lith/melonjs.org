# Making your own game

If you'd like to make your own game this is the guide for you.

## Cloning the ES6 Template

Open a terminal in the folder you'd like to clone the template project inside, then run the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate
```

Then rename the template to whatever you'd like to name your project

```
mv es6-boilerplate <project-name>
```

After that, cd into your project directory in your terminal then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate).
