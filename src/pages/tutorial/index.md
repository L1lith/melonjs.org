# melonJS: Hacking a Platformer Game
This tutorial will teach you how to hack a pre-made platformer game (a platformer game is a side-scrolling game like mario) to add your own custom assets and code in. It's sometimes easier to take something apart even if putting it back together seems challenging.

1. [Prerequisites](/tutorial/part-1-prerequisites)
2. [Setting Up the Template](/tutorial/part-2-setting-up)
3. [Modifying the game](/tutorial/part-3-modifying-the-game)
