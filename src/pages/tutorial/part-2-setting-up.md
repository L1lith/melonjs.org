# Part 2: Setting Up the Template
First open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you'd like to setup the project.

Next, clone the examples repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/melonjs/examples/tree/master/platformer
```

For this tutorial we're going to be working on the platformer example. Inside the directory we just created with git, you can see there is the `platformer` directory. Navigate into that directory, and install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

We've finished setting up, so from now on whenever you'd like to start coding your game you can navigate into the `platformer` folder in your terminal and run this command
```
npm run dev
```

This command runs the "development server". A website is hosted on your computer (usually at http://localhost:9000) so you can edit your game and try out your changes in your browser right away!
