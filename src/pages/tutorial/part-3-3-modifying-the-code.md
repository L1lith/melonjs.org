# Part 3-3: Modifying the code
Now that we've got the platformer project up and running on our computer, we can now try changing it! First we need to [open](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) the platformer project (at `/examples/platformer/`) inside VSCode to start making edits.

You should be able to see the files for the platformer example on the left side of your editor if you did this correctly:

<img alt="VSCode Screenshot" class="large" src="/img/tutorial/VSCode-platformer-files.webp"/>

These are the files used by the web server running on your computer. VS Code (the program in the screenshot) is a great tool to edit these files to change your code. However if you'd like to modify the images you're going to need specialized image editing software.
