# Part 3: Modifying the game
Changing different types of game files requires different software. Which software you should use depends on whether you are editing code files, image files, tilemaps, etc.

Part 3 is broken down into sections, with one page for each kind of file you're trying to edit:

- [Part 3-1: Modifying the Images](/tutorial/part-3-1-modifying-the-images)
- [Part 3-2: Modifying the level using Tiled](/tutorial/part-3-2-modifying-the-level)
- [Part 3-3: Modifying the Code](/tutorial/part-3-3-modifying-the-code)
