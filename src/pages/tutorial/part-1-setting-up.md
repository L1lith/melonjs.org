# Part 1 Setting Up the Template
First open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you'd like to setup the project.

Next, clone the template repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/melonjs/es6-boilerplate
```

Now you can rename the folder to whatever you'd like to call your project
```
mv es6-boilerplate my-project
```

Now navigate into the project folder
```
cd my-project
```

Next install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

We've finished setting up, so from now on whenever you'd like to start coding your game you can navigate into the project folder in your terminal and run this command
```
npm run dev
```
