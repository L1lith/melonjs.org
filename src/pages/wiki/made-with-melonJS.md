This game started out as an entry for Ludum Dare 29. Over the past year, I continued to work on it further. I wanted to build a game that didn't emphasize violence as a solution. Enemies can be more avoided instead of killed. So I made the game interesting by adding a requirement of timing and accuracy. The game has a steadily improving mood with its environment. The idea that there is hope, and that you are getting warmer.
