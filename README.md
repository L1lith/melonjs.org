This is the website for melon.js. To see how to edit it, please see [Astro](https://astro.build). Pages and components are built using HTML templates (ending in `.astro`), allowing us to split our website up into different parts. The Astro framework also supports the use of `.scss` and many other handy libraries if necessary.
